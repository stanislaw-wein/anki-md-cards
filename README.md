## About The Project

##### Disclaimer: The utility does not have advanced validation and does not cover edge cases.

Like many of you, I use the great [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) program to study everything. Since I'm used to using markdown and GitHub to save a file's
history, I created this utility. This utility converts a markdown file into an [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) file. You can import this file
into [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/).
